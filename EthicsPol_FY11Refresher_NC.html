The USG Code of Conduct provides guidance to all USG employees in applying the four core values (Integrity . Excellence . Accountability . Respect)  to the decisions and choices that are made in the course of everyday work life.
The USG Ethics Policy applies to all members of the USG community including the Board of Regents, but does not include those acting on behalf of the USG including vendors and contractors. 
It is important that all USG employees be truthful in the reporting and documenting of all work related duties including records related to appropriate arrival and departure times from work and the reporting of all forms of leave (e.g. sick and vacation).
Unacceptable violations of research integrity and non-compliance with all laws, rules and regulations governing USG could lead to monetary fines and potential criminal prosecution. 
USG employees have no responsibility to report questionable behavior including potential misuse of resources (e.g. equipment, funds, etc.)  or potential cases of sexual harassment. 
Acceptance of perks or gifts in order to influence decisions or alter the performance of employees in conducting their official duties is a violation of the USG Ethics Policy.
